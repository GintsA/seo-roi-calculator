# Reflection (Level 01)

## What I shipped (2-4 sentences)

SEO ROI tool that calculates the increase based on the expected change in traffic. It's a quick and convenient tool that does exacly one thing.

## What I cut (scope reductions) and why

All the required parts have been included. No cuts.

## What broke / surprised me

Nothing.

## Quality vs effort (what paid off)

Quality is not the best. Some bugs.

## Monetization reality check

- Hook used: "This tool is free. If you find it useful, you can support it here (optional): Buy me a coffee"
- Where it appears: README.md and in UI
- Is the disclosure honest and clear? Yes
- Friction points I noticed: Commiting to GH Pages is slow.
- One improvement I would make next time (without scope creep): More appealing UI.

## Next level readiness

- What responsibility I feel ready for next: Not sure fully.
